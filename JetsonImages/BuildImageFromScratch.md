## Build the VEX AI System from Source
Go to https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit and follow the instructions. Use the default options, but we recommend that you choose the automatic login option. Then follow the instructions below to initalize the VEX AI System.

Set-up Ubuntu on the Jetson and open a terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T)

**Ensure your Jetson is connected to the Internet via Ethernet or Wi-Fi**

*Hint: You can copy and paste in the terminal with (Ctrl + Shift + V)*

---
**This will update and upgrade the packages that come default with the Jetson**

1: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade`

**We want to install python3 and the related tools**

2: `sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends python3 python3-setuptools python3-pip python3-dev`

**Then we want to install git and clone the 'librealsense' library from Intel**

3 `sudo apt-get install git`

*`sudo apt autoremove (optional)`*

4: `git clone https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense.git`

**Now you should have a folder in your home directory named 'librealsense'**

**Navigate into the directory (cd librealsense) and run the following**

**Make sure you have all RealSense cameras unplugged**

5: `sudo apt-get install -y git libssl-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev pkg-config libgtk-3-dev`

6: `sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev at`

7: `./scripts/setup_udev_rules.sh`

8: `./scripts/patch-realsense-ubuntu-lts.sh`

**You need to now edit the .bashrc file in your home directory (`cd ..` to return)**

**Add these three lines at the bottom (use text edit, vim, emacs, nano, or any text editor of your choice) :**

9: `export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}`

10: `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}`

11: `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/OFF`

**You either need to close and reopen the terminal or in the home directory execute `source ./.bashrc`**

**Now it is time to build the Realsense package, return to 'librealsense'(`cd librealsense`)**

12: `mkdir build && cd build`

**You can check that CUDA is installed correctly with `nvcc --version` and it outputs information about the NVIDIA CUDA version.**

**Build the files**

13: `cmake ../ -DFORCE_RSUSB_BACKEND=ON -DBUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS:bool=true -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=true -DBUILD_GRAPHICAL_EXAMPLES=true -DBUILD_WITH_CUDA:bool=true`

**This next one is gonna take a while (like 30+ min)! The -j2 flag means to use 2 cores in parallel and this command is very likely going to crash your Jetson. See *troubleshooting* below. But you can remove it and simply run `sudo make` instead, which will take longer**

14: `sudo make uninstall && sudo make clean && sudo make -j2 && sudo make install`

**When you want to run a python script and use the pyrealsense2 library, make sure to use**
`python3`

**Clone the GitHub repository with all of the example source code**

15: `git clone https://github.com/VEX-Robotics/VAIC_23_24.git`

**Navigate into the source directory (`cd VAIC_23_24/JetsonExample`)**

**Install all the required python packages**

16:
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip3 install pyserial
pip3 install websocket-server
pip3 install pycuda
pip3 install tensorrt
python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
```

17: `sudo usermod -a <USERNAME> -G dialout`

**BEFORE PROCEEDING, MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW THE STEPS TO SET-UP THE VEX AI WEB DASHBOARD**

[Install NodeJS and Build the Server](../JetsonWebDashboard/README.md)

**Navigate into the Scripts folder within the source directory (`cd Scripts`)**

**Run the script that will install the vexai service to start object detection for the VEX AI Compeittion upon start up**

18: `sudo chmod +x service.sh`

19: `sudo chmod +x run.sh`

20: `sudo bash ./service.sh`

***The python script running object detection will now run in the background upon start up***

**Now, re-boot your Jetson**

## Troubleshooting

`Commands 9, 10, 14`: Not sure how to edit the .bashrc file? Here are some steps:
1. Open the file explorer in Ubuntu.
2. Make sure you are in the "Home" tab, in the top right corner, click on the hamburger menu (â˜°).
3. Check the box for "Show Hidden Files".
4. You should see ".bashrc" now, double click to open and scroll to the bottom.
5. Add the necessary lines to the end and save (Ctrl + S).

`Command 13`: If your Jetson crashes and freezes during this command, takes the following steps:
1. Restart your Jetson (unplug the power source and plug it back in).
2. Reopen a terminal and navigate back to the build directory (cd librealsense/build).
3. Run: sudo make uninstall && sudo make clean && sudo make && sudo make install
4. If it crashes again, make sure your power source is sufficient, and try setting your device to 5W mode. (See section about crashes below).

If you run into an issue with Engine serialization, try deleting the .trt file to regenerate the tensor engine.

## General Issues and Tips:

***Open this page on your Jetson, so you can copy and paste!***

**Crashes:**

If your Jetson Nano keeps on crashing and randomly shutting off, this is mostly likely a power issue. The Barrel Jack connector only supplies a limited amount of power from the V5 Brain, often when running the JetsonExample, the processing power can be quite intensive drawing more power than able to be supplied, turning off the Jetson. To resolve this issue, you can either go into 5W Power Mode or use the VEX Power Mode. To install the VEX Power Mode:
1. Navigate to the VAIC_23_24 folder, then the JetsonExample and Scripts Folder (`cd VAIC_23_24/JetsonExample/Scripts`).
2. Run: sudo bash ./power.sh
3. Restart your Jetson to ensure the changes take effect.

**Remove Bloatware:**

1. Navigate to the VAIC_23_24 folder, then the JetsonExample and Scripts Folder (`cd VAIC_23_24/JetsonExample/Scripts`).
2. Run: sudo bash ./clean.sh

**"Using an engine plan file across different models of devices is not reccommended...":**

This is a warning that occurs when the engine builder in model.py detects a different .trt engine file than expected. While it may or may not be built from a different device, you can generally ignore this warning. To clear it, delete the .trt file from your folder and it will generate a new one.
